## Project Motivation
Kickstarter is a platform that helps people to raise funds for their projects. Each project will have a 'goal' that represents the amount of money that the product owner is hoping to raise. The people who contributed their money into the project are called 'backers'.

This project aims to provide insights into the different factors that can affect the success of a Kickstarter project. With this analysis, I hope that future fundraisers, or even backers, can be more discerning about the project elements to take into account to boost the chances of getting successful project.
